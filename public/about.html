<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I’m Mayur Shevale, a passionate and driven individual with a strong academic foundation in Computer Science and a relentless curiosity for Data Science. I hold a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Computer Science, where I developed a solid understanding of programming, algorithms,
   and problem-solving. Currently, I am pursuing an advanced degree in Data Science and its Applications from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, 
   where I am honing my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence..</p>

<p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I am actively involved in the entrepreneurial world as a key contributor to Sanghamitra, 
  a dynamic business that specializes in creating high-quality, customizable products such as frames, cups, T-shirts, and more. My role has allowed me to develop and refine essential marketing and sales skills, from managing product stalls to driving online sales through our website, www.sanghamitra.store. 
  This hands-on experience has given me a deep understanding of customer engagement, brand building, and e-commerce strategies.</p>

<p>On the technical side, I have a strong foundation in Python programming, bolstered by a certification from MIT University through the edX platform. This knowledge has been instrumental in my journey into data science, enabling me to tackle complex problems and build innovative solutions.
  I am a firm believer in continuous learning and growth, and I am excited to leverage my diverse skill set—spanning technology, data science, and business—to create meaningful impact in the world. 
  Whether it’s analyzing data to uncover insights or crafting strategies to grow a business, I thrive on challenges and am always eager to push boundaries.</p>
